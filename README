This is a simple game, all you have to do is get your cursor to the 
exit.

The game can be run with the following command:

== Changing the game
The folder name 'media' contains all sprites used in the game, you can change them
as you wish

Also settings.yml contains your high score, and the speed at which the
blocks change size. You can change them to your hearts content
